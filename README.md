| Code Style                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                           |         |       |
| Identifiers are in the correct case, are not misspelled, are meaningful, and help me understand the code. No. Single. Letter. Variables.                                                                                                                     | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Indentation and use of white space is correct and contributes to the code's consistency and readability. There are NO STYLE WARNINGS offered by PyCharm.                                                                                                     | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Functions contain 15 or fewer lines of code. Exceptions are made of course for functions that initialize large data structures or print ASCII, etc.                                                                                                          | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| No. Global. Variables. Constants are encapsulated in immutable data structures or are declared and initialized at the top of the file with appropriate UPPER_CASE names. Constants are grouped together immediately below import statements.                 | board/make_board.py and board/init.py                     | 6-34    |       |
| All functions are annotated where it makes sense for them to be annotated.                                                                                                                                                                                   | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Evidence submitted that the developer(s) played Aardwolf and reached level 10.                                                                                                                                                                               | AARDWOLF Level 10.pdf                                     |         |       |
| Testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                           |         |       |
| Doctests are included for all functions that can be tested with doctests.                                                                                                                                                                                    | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Doctests correctly demonstrate how to use the function --2-3 important cases is enough!                                                                                                                                                                      | character/character.py                                    | 29-64   |       |
| Unit tests are included for all functions that can be tested with unit tests.                                                                                                                                                                                | character/shop.py buy_items(), tests in test_buy_items.py | 26-56   |       |
| Unit tests correctly and thoroughly demonstrate how each function will react to each legal disjointed equivalency partition or equivalent.                                                                                                                   | character/shop.py buy_items(), tests in test_buy_items.py | 26-56   |       |
| Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                           |         |       |
| Code compiles and the program executes without errors or warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                           | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| The game board is 5 x 5 for individual developers or 10 x 10 for pairs and is managed efficiently. There does not have to be a 2D list. There does not have to be a dictionary. It can be virtual!                                                           | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Gameplay ends correctly when it is supposed to.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| Character movement and restrictions on character movement are correct, that is, the character can move north south east and west, and cannot cross the gamespace boundaries.                                                                                 | movement/movement.py                                      |         |       |
| There is a coherent and rich ecosystem of challenges. The challenges are not all the same. Some are more challenging than others. It is not impossible for me to win. Things "scale" nicely.                                                                 | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| Mutability is minimized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| Scope of mutables is minimized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| There is one or more list and/or dictionary comprehensions used in a manner that is correct and makes your code shorter and easier to read.                                                                                                                  | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| There is selection using if-statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | pokemon/capturing_pokemon.py capture_pokemon()            | 34-65   |       |
| There is repetition using the for-loop and/or the while loop. Flat is better than nested.                                                                                                                                                                    | combat/combat.py combat_loop()                            | 205-237 |       |
| The membership operator is used correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | character/character.py choose_starter_pokemon()           | 5-26    |       |
| The range function is used correctly to make your code more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                       | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |         |       |
| One or more functions from itertools is thoughtfully used at least once in a correct way.                                                                                                                                                                    | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |       |
| The random module is used correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | utilities/utilities.py one_in_number_odds()               | 105-119 |       |
| All output for the user is nicely formatted f-strings and/or str.format and/or %-formatting.                                                                                                                                                                 | character/character.py swap_pokemon()                     | 68-101  |       |

| The flowchart represents a game not a program. It represents gameplay but not the code that implements the game. This flowchart is language agnostic.

| OVERALL IMPRESSION: A slightly subjective but mostly objective overall assessment of the elegance, scale, and sophistication of design presented. This includes consistency of code style and commenting, quality of tests, parsimony and excellent in code. |                                                           |         |       |
