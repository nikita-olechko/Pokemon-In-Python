| Code Style                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                           |         |       |
| Identifiers are in the correct case, are not misspelled, are meaningful, and help me understand the code. No. Single. Letter. Variables.                                                                                                                     | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Indentation and use of white space is correct and contributes to the code's consistency and readability. There are NO STYLE WARNINGS offered by PyCharm.                                                                                                     | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Functions contain 15 or fewer lines of code. Exceptions are made of course for functions that initialize large data structures or print ASCII, etc.                                                                                                          | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| No. Global. Variables. Constants are encapsulated in immutable data structures or are declared and initialized at the top of the file with appropriate UPPER_CASE names. Constants are grouped together immediately below import statements.                 | board/make_board.py and board/init.py                     | 6-34    |       |
| All functions are annotated where it makes sense for them to be annotated.                                                                                                                                                                                   | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Evidence submitted that the developer(s) played Aardwolf and reached level 10.                                                                                                                                                                               | AARDWOLF Level 10.pdf                                     |         |       |
| Testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                           |         |       |
| Doctests are included for all functions that can be tested with doctests.                                                                                                                                                                                    | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Doctests correctly demonstrate how to use the function --2-3 important cases is enough!                                                                                                                                                                      | character/character.py                                    | 29-64   |       |
| Unit tests are included for all functions that can be tested with unit tests.                                                                                                                                                                                | character/shop.py buy_items(), tests in test_buy_items.py | 26-56   |       |
| Unit tests correctly and thoroughly demonstrate how each function will react to each legal disjointed equivalency partition or equivalent.                                                                                                                   | character/shop.py buy_items(), tests in test_buy_items.py | 26-56   |       |
| Implementation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                           |         |       |
| Code compiles and the program executes without errors or warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                           | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| The game board is 5 x 5 for individual developers or 10 x 10 for pairs and is managed efficiently. There does not have to be a 2D list. There does not have to be a dictionary. It can be virtual!                                                           | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| Gameplay ends correctly when it is supposed to.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| Character movement and restrictions on character movement are correct, that is, the character can move north south east and west, and cannot cross the gamespace boundaries.                                                                                 | movement/movement.py                                      |         |       |
| There is a coherent and rich ecosystem of challenges. The challenges are not all the same. Some are more challenging than others. It is not impossible for me to win. Things "scale" nicely.                                                                 | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| Mutability is minimized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| Scope of mutables is minimized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | game.py                                                   |         |       |
| There is one or more list and/or dictionary comprehensions used in a manner that is correct and makes your code shorter and easier to read.                                                                                                                  | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |
| There is selection using if-statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | pokemon/capturing_pokemon.py capture_pokemon()            | 34-65   |       |
| There is repetition using the for-loop and/or the while loop. Flat is better than nested.                                                                                                                                                                    | combat/combat.py combat_loop()                            | 205-237 |       |
| The membership operator is used correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | character/character.py choose_starter_pokemon()           | 5-26    |       |
| The range function is used correctly to make your code more efficient.                                                                                                                                                                                       | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |         |       |
| One or more functions from itertools is thoughtfully used at least once in a correct way.                                                                                                                                                                    | board/make_board.py make_board()                          | 6-34    |       |       |
| The random module is used correctly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | utilities/utilities.py one_in_number_odds()               | 105-119 |       |
| All output for the user is nicely formatted f-strings and/or str.format and/or %-formatting.                                                                                                                                                                 | character/character.py swap_pokemon()                     | 68-101  |       |
